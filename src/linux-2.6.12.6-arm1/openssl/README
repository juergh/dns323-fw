OpenSSL
===========
 In order to explore the Orion CESA through the OpenSSL, you have to use the OpenSSL OCF cryptodev engine.
 By default the cryptodev engine will use the CESA accelerator.

 On the Orion FS create a crypto dev: mknod /dev/crypto c 10 70
 download openssl-0.9.7e (http://www.openssl.org/), then untar+unzip it.
 apply the patches (in the following order):
  - openssl-0.9.7e.diff - a patch from OCF for the OpenSSL cryptodev, with a our patch to support AES256 and more.
  - speed_multi.diff - fix for multi task results reporting. (NOT A MUST)
 and compile ...

 you can run a speed test to make sure everything is working:
 openssl speed -evp des-ede3-cbc -size 8192 -elapsed            Vs.
 openssl speed -evp des-ede3-cbc -engine cryptodev -size 8192 -elapsed

  OpenSSH
==========
 This release also include a patch from the OCF release, which enables cryptodev by default.
 download openssh-3.7.1p2.diff, then untar+unzip it.
 apply the patch openssh-3.7.1p2.diff.
 and compile ...

 you can run:
 ssh  -c 3des-cbc -l <user name> <IP>
