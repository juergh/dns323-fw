2. Changes from prev Releases
===================================================
 Changes from prev Release 1.7.5
==================================
 - DMA: Use polling on dma channel status bits and not on interrupt, to eliminate any race on the clearing of the IDMA interrupt register
	between the CESA engine and the SW.
 - ocf-bench: Add reinsertion of failed requests, with a timeout of 1 ms.
 - CESA HAL: Bugs: A large buffer might have sent to channel 1.
		   A Jumbo buffer might have being insert to channel 0 while another buffer is using one of the other channels.
	     Fix: Change the logical flow for inserting request through the Action and the ReadyGet API.
 - CESA OCF: Add debug APIs.
 - Add Raid-0  support to default config option.

 Changes from prev Release 1.7.4
==================================
 - Add WA to CESA: remove the clear of the idma engine, since it is already done by the HW.
 - Add WA to DMA_CPY: clear only relevant bits in idma cause register.
 - Add WA to the Eth HAL: leave one spare Tx descriptor in the link list.

 Changes from prev Release 1.7.3
==================================
 - Fix a bug in dm-crypt, wrong essiv size when rounding to minimum.
 - Add non CFI to the default kernel config.

 Changes from prev Release 1.7.2
==================================
 - Update board Spec for 5281 and remove tiny option for 5182.
 - Add RTC device registration.
 - Improve the cesa debug reports.
 - Fix Cesa HAL to clear only relevant bits for channel 0 and 1 from the IDMA cause register.
 - Add physical mapping of the boot flash for RD-5182.
 - Move the eGiga Tx done handling to the NAPI polling.
 - Add support for sending idle and idle immediate command through the smart interface.
 - Fix a bug in dm-crypt: dm-crypt doesn't work in essiv mode when using the OCF.
 - Add the option for the dm-crypt to use part of the hash result for the cipher in essiv mode.
 - Enlarge the write timeout for dm-crypt from 2 sec to 30 sec.
 - Fix a bug in openswan: when removing ipsec module get an error "badness in removing .."

 Changes from prev Release 1.7.1
==================================
 - Use the Orion Internal DMAs in order to copy buffer from User to Kernel and backwards.
 - Fix Cesa HAL to clear only relevant bits for channel 0 and 1 from the IDMA cause register.

 Changes from Release 1.7.0
==================================
 - Compile with the new EABI flag.
 - Update last HALs, including last CESA HAL code.
 - Use kernel 2.6.12.6 as a baseline instead of 2.6.12.

3. CESA (Cryptographic Engine and Security acceleration)
========================================================
 This release include the OCF (http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/) code, and add support for using the Orion CESA through the OCF.
 By using the OCF interface, this release supports Encryption/Authentication HW acceleration on the following:
 	OpenSSL - See openssl/README.
 	OpenSWAN - See openswan/README.
 	dm-crypt - (http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/) 
		   a patch is already applied on drivers/md/dm-crypt.c which includes OCF support.

 Check OCF configuration under Cryptographic Options (Kconfig).

4. Notes
========
	HowTo:
		get linux-2.6.12,
		change its name to the release name.
		unzip the release.zip in the directory where you put the kernel, say A to replace all.
		cd to the kernel directory.
		'make mrproper'
		'make db88f5182_defconfig'
		'make uImage'
